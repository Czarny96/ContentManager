# ContentManager

Application to manage the content on dedicated web pages. A non-technical user can use the user interface to edit text or other content in the application. Frontend or backend applications can download resources by API. The application is not like a CMS because we do not create websites based on layout or simple functionality, using fully customized solutions.
